\chapter{Divide \& Conquer}

\section{Principles}
\runinhead{Divide.}\runinhead{Reduce \# sub-problems.} After dividing, we have $a$ subproblems. Now need to identify the redundancy in the $a$ sub-problems. Find the common shared calculations among sub-problems and thus try to reduce $a$ to $a-1$. Identify the \textbf{commonality}.
\runinhead{Sub-problem dimension.} Reduce the dimensionality of the original problem; thus consider the simpler version of the problem.
\runinhead{Input dimension.}  Increase the representation dimensionality of the input. For example, in FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) augment the input with complex space. 
\begin{align*}
w_{j, k} = e^{j2\pi i/k}
\end{align*}
