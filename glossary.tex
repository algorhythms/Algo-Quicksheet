\runinhead{non-degeneracy} Distinct properties without total overlapping
\runinhead{underflow} Degenerated, empty, or null case
\runinhead{loitering} Holding a reference to an object when it is no longer needed thus hindering garbage collection. 
\runinhead{subsarray} Continuous subarray $A[i:j]$
\runinhead{subsequence} Non-continuous ordered subsequence that $S\subset A[i:j]$.
