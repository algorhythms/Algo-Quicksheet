\foreword

Use the template \textit{foreword.tex} together with the Springer document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style your foreword\index{foreword} in the Springer layout. 

The foreword covers introductory remarks preceding the text of a book that are written by a \textit{person other than the author or editor} of the book. If applicable, the foreword precedes the preface which is written by the author or editor of the book.
