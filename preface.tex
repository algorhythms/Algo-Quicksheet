\section*{Introduction}
This quicksheet contains many classical equations and diagrams for algorithm, which helps you quickly recall knowledge and ideas in algorithm.\\

This quicksheet has three significant advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Non-essential knowledge points omitted
\item Compact knowledge representation
\item Quick recall
\end{enumerate}
\section*{How to Use This Quicksheet}
High-level abstraction is the key. You should not attempt to remember the details of an algorithm. Instead, you should know:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What problems this algorithm solves.
\item The benefits of using this algorithm compared to others.
\item The important clues of this algorithm so that you can derive the details of the algorithm from them.
\end{enumerate}
The codes are just the details of implementation. Remembering them is simply unproductive and non-scalable. Only dive into the codes when you are unable to reconstruct the algorithm from the hits and clues.
